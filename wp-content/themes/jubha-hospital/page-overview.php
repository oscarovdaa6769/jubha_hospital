                              <h2>Driven by the concern to provide healthcare services for the local community, Sheikh Mohammed Abdulla Almana opened the doors of the first healthcare center in the Eastern Province in 1949.</h2>
                              <p>The beginning was a humble effort. The Group began with modest sized clinics for dental and ophthalmic care. Over the decades these clinics expanded into five large independent ultra-modern hospitals with 3 additional specialized medical centers with out-patient services and medical dispensaries in the four major cities of the Eastern Province, namely, Al-Asha Dammam, Al-Khobar and Jubail.</p>
